# Dream Coaching Testing
Return back to the [README.md](/README.md)

The testing process has been broken down into two sections; one from a users point of view which focuses on how your typical user might interact with the website, the other is from an administrative point of view and how they might check the site is functioning as expected while also using features only available to them to adjust the site by adding/removing items etc.

# User Focused Testing

# Admin Focused Testing
This section consists of all the testing relating to the admin features.

# Validator Testing

## HTML Validation
All pages were passed through the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fdream-coaching.herokuapp.com%2F)

I passed all the pages through using both the URL and the actual page source to be sure that there were no errors.
