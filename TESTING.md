Return back to the [README.md](/README.md)

The testing process has been broken down into two sections; one from a users point of view which focuses on how your typical user might interact with the website, the other is from an administrative point of view and how they might check the site is functioning as expected while also using features only available to them to adjust the site by adding/removing items etc.
