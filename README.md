## [User Stories](https://github.com/GitHub-Harrison/dream-coaching/projects/1)
One of the first things I did after deciding what my project would be was to create some user stories to help figure out what functionality the website would need.

After listing out the basic user stories that would help me create a complete ecommerce website I created a [kanban project board](https://github.com/GitHub-Harrison/dream-coaching/projects/1) where I would move the stories into columns depending on what stage I was on (To do, Put on hold, In progress, Finished and Discarded).
